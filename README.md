# poptab
A chrome extension which pops tabs into popups

To install poptab:
-Download all the files into a directory called `poptab`.  
-Open Settings | Extensions in Chrome
-Drag the folder into your chrome window.  

Quick and dirty, but works.  Click the `HELLO` button to pop a tab into a new popup.  Sorry, there's no way to bring it back.
